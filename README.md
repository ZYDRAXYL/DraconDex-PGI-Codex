# DraconDex-PGI-Codex

A Codex (OpenAI) chat session for
[DraconDex](https://github.com/ZYDRAXYL/DraconDex-APP), in DraconDex 5's side panel.

Install it, open any page, and a **🤖** button appears on the page's address
row. Click it and a chat panel opens in the side panel beside the page, scoped to
the module you are on — and it follows you: move to another module and the
panel switches to that module's conversation. It also runs as a standalone window if you'd rather have
the room.

This is the OpenAI sibling of
[DraconDex-PGI-Claude](https://github.com/ZYDRAXYL/DraconDex-PGI-Claude) —
same layout, same panel behaviour, different provider. Both can be installed at
once; they use different plugin ids and therefore different tables.

> Written for **DraconDex 5** (side panel). On **4.3.0–4.x** the panel docks in
> place of the Module Inspector instead. Requires **4.3.0+** for the panel at all.
> On 4.2.x it still installs
> and works as a plain window (Settings → Plugin → Launch) — there is just no
> button in the main window, because the panel API doesn't exist there yet.
> **DraconDex 4.8.0+** additionally auto-installs
> [AI Native](https://github.com/ZYDRAXYL/DraconDex-PGI-AINative) the first time
> this plugin is installed (see [App context](#app-context-ai-native) below).
> On older versions this plugin still installs and works exactly the same —
> the app just doesn't know to look at the manifest's `dependencies` field
> yet, so nothing else gets pulled in automatically.

## Connecting

Two modes, in Settings inside the plugin. Both send
`Authorization: Bearer …`; they differ in where the token comes from and which
endpoint it is spent at.

### API key — supported, works today

Paste an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Requests go to
`https://api.openai.com/v1/responses`. That's the whole setup.

### Subscription (OAuth) — read this first

OpenAI publishes **no supported API** for driving a ChatGPT subscription from a
third-party app, and this plugin does not invent one. What this mode implements
is a standard **OAuth 2.0 + PKCE** client against endpoints *you* supply, and it
posts to the undocumented ChatGPT backend
(`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`), which may refuse an
unfamiliar client. There are two ways in:

**1. Sign in** — fill in a client ID, authorize URL and token URL (the
`auth.openai.com` endpoints are prefilled), then press Sign in. Your system
browser opens and DraconDex captures the redirect, because a plugin page cannot
listen on a port. The token exchange happens inside the plugin, so a client
secret never leaves it, and access tokens are refreshed before they expire.

> **The catch.** DraconDex's redirect receiver binds a **random** loopback port
> — `http://127.0.0.1:<random>/callback`
> ([`src/db/oauth-loopback.js`](https://github.com/ZYDRAXYL/DraconDex-APP/blob/main/src/db/oauth-loopback.js)
> calls `srv.listen(0)`). A provider that requires one exact pre-registered
> redirect URI will reject that, and OpenAI's own Codex client requires
> `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`. So this path works only with an OAuth
> client that accepts dynamic loopback ports, per
> [RFC 8252 §7.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252#section-7.3).

**2. Local CLI** — for everyone the catch above applies to, and the more
practical way in regardless. If you have already signed in with the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)
(`codex login` writes `~/.codex/auth.json`), paste the access token — plus the
refresh token if you want it renewed automatically, and a ChatGPT account id if
your token spans several workspaces. It is stored and used exactly like one
obtained by signing in above. This plugin never runs the CLI itself — a plugin
page has no process access to do that, by design (see
[DraconDex-APP's `docs/PLUGINS.md`](https://github.com/ZYDRAXYL/DraconDex-APP/blob/main/docs/PLUGINS.md)
§2.4) — it only accepts whatever token `codex login` already produced.

If neither fits, use API key mode.

## What it can do

- Streams replies as they arrive, with **Stop**
- Any model id the endpoint accepts — the picker is a free-text field with
  suggestions, plus a **Fetch models** button that replaces them with what your
  credentials can actually reach
- Reasoning effort (`minimal` … `xhigh`) and an optional streamed summary of the
  model's reasoning
- Optional system prompt, adjustable max output tokens, overridable base URL
- One conversation per module, kept separate, plus a History tab
- Surfaces refusals, cut-off responses, rate limits and API errors as
  themselves, with **Retry** — rather than swallowing them

Not included: tool use / function calling, file attachments, and server-side
conversation state (`store` is `false`; the transcript is replayed from this
plugin's own tables each turn).

## App context (AI Native)

This plugin declares
[DraconDex-PGI-AINative](https://github.com/ZYDRAXYL/DraconDex-PGI-AINative)
("AI Native") as a manifest `dependencies` entry, so installing this plugin
auto-installs that one too (DraconDex 4.8.0+). AI Native publishes
`catalog.json` — a small public file describing DraconDex's features and what
a plugin can/can't do.

A plugin can't read another plugin's table or files even once both are
installed side by side, so this plugin doesn't reach into AI Native directly —
instead, on boot it fetches `catalog.json` straight from that repo
(`https://raw.githubusercontent.com`, declared in `permissions.net` alongside
the OpenAI/ChatGPT hosts above) and folds a short summary into the system
prompt sent with every message, ahead of whatever you wrote in Settings. Your
own system prompt is never edited or replaced, just prefixed for the outgoing
request. No internet access to that host, or an older DraconDex with no
`pluginApi.net`? Chat still works fine — just without the app-context
preamble.

## Where your data goes

- **Conversations** live in this plugin's own SQLite tables inside your vault
  (`plg_codex_chat_session` / `_message` / `_config`). They are never sent
  anywhere except to the endpoint you configured, as conversation history.
- **Your API key and OAuth tokens** are stored in that same `config` table **in
  plain text**. DraconDex has no encrypted credential store — it keeps its own
  Google Drive client secret the same way — so this is consistent with the rest
  of the app, not better than it. Treat your vault file accordingly.
- **Network access** is restricted by the manifest to `https://api.openai.com`,
  `https://auth.openai.com` and `https://chatgpt.com`, and nothing else.
  DraconDex shows those hosts in the install preview before you confirm, and
  enforces them at runtime — a base URL pointing anywhere else is refused.

## The manifest

```json
{
  "id": "codex_chat",
  "name": "Codex Chat",
  "entry": "index.html",
  "files": ["index.html", "panel.html", "…"],
  "panels": [
    { "id": "chat", "title": "Codex", "icon": "🤖", "entry": "panel.html" }
  ],
  "permissions": {
    "net": ["https://api.openai.com", "https://auth.openai.com", "https://chatgpt.com", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com"],
    "context": ["module"]
  },
  "dependencies": ["https://github.com/ZYDRAXYL/DraconDex-PGI-AINative"],
  "tables": [ "…" ]
}
```

`panels` and `permissions` are the DraconDex 4.3.0 additions; `dependencies`
is 4.8.0 (see [App context](#app-context-ai-native) above); everything else
is the plugin format from 4.2.0. Full rules are in
[DraconDex-APP's `docs/PLUGINS.md`](https://github.com/ZYDRAXYL/DraconDex-APP/blob/main/docs/PLUGINS.md).

`permissions.context: ["module"]` lets the panel receive the open module's id,
name and kind — enough to keep one conversation per module and to title it.
Nothing about the module's *content* is shared.

Note that `permissions.net` also gates OAuth: DraconDex checks the authorize
URL's origin against this same list before opening the browser, which is why the
auth hosts are declared here and not only the API host.

## Structure

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dracondex-plugin.json` | Manifest: id, files, panel, permissions, table schema. |
| `index.html` + `app.js` | Standalone-window entry (draws its own title bar). |
| `panel.html` + `panel.js` | Side-panel entry; asks the host for module context and follows the page as v5 pushes new context. |
| `src/store.js` | The three tables, via `window.pluginApi.table.*`. |
| `src/provider.js` | Responses API client + both auth modes. |
| `src/catalog.js` | Fetches/caches AI Native's `catalog.json`; composes the app-context preamble onto the system prompt. Independent of `provider.js` — different origin, own `pluginApi.net` call. |
| `src/chat.js` | Session and turn state; no DOM. |
| `src/ui.js` | Rendering. Builds nodes, never HTML strings. |
| `style.css` | Dark theme matching the app; works at 290px and at 900px. |
| `tools/validate-manifest.mjs` | Local manifest check running the app's own `validateManifest()`. Not shipped — it isn't in `files` |
| `tools/plugin-manifest.cjs` + `plugin-contract.lock.json` | That function: DraconDex-EXE's `plugin-manifest.js`, vendored byte-identical at a pinned release. Never hand-edit; move the pin with `node tools/plugin-contract.mjs --vendor --ref vX.Y.Z`. |
| `tools/plugin-contract.mjs` | Checks the vendored copy; `--upstream` says whether DraconDex moved past the pin. |
| `test/provider.test.mjs` | Drives `provider.js` against canned SSE. Not shipped. |
| `test/catalog.test.mjs` | Drives `catalog.js` against a fake `pluginApi.net`/`Store`/page `fetch`. Not shipped. |

Both entries load the same five `src/` scripts and differ only in chrome.

### A constraint worth knowing if you fork this

A panel can go away at any moment: DraconDex 5 keeps it open across page
changes but destroys it when the side panel is closed or the app quits (and a
4.x host reloaded it on every pane re-render). Nothing may live only in a
variable. Every message is written to the table at the moment it exists (the
question before the request goes out, the answer as soon as the stream ends),
and the panel rebuilds itself from the tables on every load. A reply that was
still streaming when the panel went away is the only thing that can be lost.

While it is open, DraconDex 5 pushes a new module context on every page
change, and the chat follows the page: it switches to that module's own
conversation (or an empty one), never mid-reply — a reply that is still
streaming finishes in the conversation it started in, then the switch
happens.

## Developing

```bash
node tools/validate-manifest.mjs          # the app's own rules (vendored), first error first
node tools/plugin-contract.mjs            # the vendored copy matches plugin-contract.lock.json
node --check app.js panel.js src/*.js
node --test test/*.test.mjs
```

Then in DraconDex: **Settings → Plugin → Plugins**, paste this repo's link,
confirm the preview. Reinstalling after a change means uninstalling first (the
same `id` can't install twice), and **uninstalling permanently deletes this
plugin's conversations** — so don't develop against a vault you care about.
